Abstract
In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to
perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultane-
ously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable
the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize
a block-wise processing approach. This strategy effectively decouples the handling of
long sequences of multimodal data, assigning the perceptual responsibilities to the mul-
timodal encoder and entrusting the modeling of extended sequences to a large language
model. Such a division of labor enhances the fusion of different modalities via the shared
attention mechanism. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we
organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel
position embedding approach, named TMRoPE (Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE ). To
concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two
modalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework, Thinker func-
tions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track
autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to
produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be
trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming
manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming
to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with similarly sized
Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably,
Qwen2.5-Omni ’s performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable
to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and
GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni’s streaming Talker outperforms most
existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.
Figure 1: Qwen2.5-Omni is a unified end-to-end model capable of processing multiple modalities, such
as text, audio, image and video, and generating real-time text or speech response. Based on these
features, Qwen2.5-Omni supports a wide range of tasks, including but not limited to voice dialogue,
video dialogue, and video reasoning.

1 Introduction
In daily life, humans are capable of simultaneously perceiving the visual and auditory information
around them. After processing this information through the brain, they express feedback through
writing, vocalization, or using tools (and physical actions), thereby engaging in information exchange
